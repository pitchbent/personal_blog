# Intro
Hi there! I got a home studio. But I do not have that much space in my flat, so things need to be movable. I bought a keyboard stand for my Kontrol S61 but it did not have any casters - so I 3D printed some adapters to add some. 


# Materials
The parts are avaiable on AliExpress. Maybe you got some screws & inserts laying around - who knows.

The mounts were 3D printed using Extrudr PLA.

# Design

The casters are designed to have a snug fit onto the feet of the keyboard stand. To further improve it, I added a grub screw. All threads are done with brass inserts, which can be easily inserted using a soldering iron. I designed the part using Fusion360. The files are avaiable at the end of this post.
