# Intro
Hi there! I got a home studio. But I do not have that much space in my flat, so things need to be movable. I bought a keyboard stand for my Kontrol S61 but it did not have any casters - so I 3D printed some adapters to add some. 


# Materials
The parts are avaiable on AliExpress. Maybe you got some screws & inserts laying around - who knows.
